##  Purpose :
Provide Users to draw in their virtual environment in real time , allowing them to paint in 4 different colors and provide a clear button also.

## Features :

<ul>
  <li>The "Air Canvas" project enables real-time hand detection and tracking using Mediapipe for precise interactions.</li>
  <li>The canvas interface is designed to offer an intuitive drawing experience with interactive ink buttons.</li>
  <li>Different coloured markers are represented by deques, allowing users to draw with 4 colour options - blue, green, red, and yellow.</li>
  <li>A dynamic paint window displays the drawn lines in real-time, ensuring smooth rendering and responsiveness.</li>
  <li>The "Clear" button resets the canvas, while selecting a specific colour triggers drawing with that colour.</li>
  <li>The project leverages OpenCV for morphological operations, optimizing marker tracking and enhancing accuracy.</li>
  <li>Real-time performance at 30 fps is achieved, catering to a wide range of hardware configurations.</li>
  <li>The "Air Canvas" project has received significant recognition, being featured on a prominent AI blog with over 10,000 views.</li>
</ul>
